# Students

Just a simple application to see how to build something in modern Node.

## Requirements

* Node v20.9.0

## Build

```
npm install
```

Run it with:

```
npm start run
```

Type `help` for the list of commands.
When you type `end` or `quit` it will show the averages per course per student.

NOTE: You can also usee `bun` as a runtime. Works a 100%.

# Evaluation

## The good

    You can use classes and proper OO.
    I still do not like the brittle node modules. When including a package it is automatically included with ^ before the version... it's bad.

## The bad

    I am still not a super fan of node. At least not for server-side.

## The ugly

    You need to include the node module `esm` to use modern JavaScript ECMAScript modules.
